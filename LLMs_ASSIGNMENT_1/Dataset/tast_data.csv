"The Istanbul International Center for Private Sector in Development (IICPSD), established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Government of Turkey in 2011, serves as a global hub for leveraging the potential of the private sector to drive sustainable development and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The center's mission is to engage businesses in development efforts by fostering innovative business models, partnerships, and practices that promote inclusive and sustainable growth. IICPSD focuses on several key areas, including the promotion of inclusive business models that integrate low-income communities into value chains as suppliers, distributors, retailers, or customers, thereby creating economic opportunities and improving livelihoods for marginalized populations. The center also facilitates the formation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to address complex development challenges, bringing together governments, businesses, and civil society to leverage their collective strengths and resources. Additionally, IICPSD supports the growth of impact investment, which seeks to generate positive social and environmental impacts alongside financial returns, by creating a conducive environment for impact investors and social enterprises. In times of humanitarian crises and natural disasters, the center plays a crucial role in mobilizing the private sector's resources and expertise, ensuring that contributions are effective and aligned with broader development objectives. Furthermore, IICPSD is dedicated to capacity building and knowledge sharing, offering training, research, and platforms to enhance the ability of businesses and other stakeholders to engage in sustainable development. By disseminating best practices, case studies, and innovative tools, the center helps foster a global community committed to inclusive and sustainable growth, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and resilient world."
