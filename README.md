## Text Summarization Using 'philschmid/flan-t5-base-samsum'


Description
This project aims to create a model for summarizing long texts into short, concise summaries using the pre-trained 'philschmid/flan-t5-base-samsum' model from the Hugging Face library.

## Objective
To use the pre-trained model to summarize long texts, making it easier for users to quickly understand the main content.

## Problem
Individuals often struggle with reading and understanding large amounts of long texts. Summarizing these texts can save time and effort by providing essential information in a concise format.

## Solution
Utilize the 'philschmid/flan-t5-base-samsum' model to generate high-quality summaries of long texts. This model is particularly effective for summarizing large texts found in articles, reports, and research papers, making it an invaluable tool for researchers, students, and professionals who need to quickly grasp the main points of extensive documents.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
This project supports Goal 4 (Quality Education) by improving access to information.

## Data Preparation
We prepared a dataset containing long texts that need to be summarized.

## Testing the Model
We tested the model by summarizing various long texts, achieving concise and informative summaries. The model demonstrated its capability to handle large texts effectively, providing clear and accurate summaries that capture the essence of the original content.
